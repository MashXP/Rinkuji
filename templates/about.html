            <h2>What is Rinkuji?</h2>
            <p>
                Rinkuji (リンク字) is a web application designed to help you explore the intricate connections between Japanese words and the kanji they contain. By inputting a word, you can generate a dynamic, interactive graph that visually maps out the relationships between kanji, their components, and other related words.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to provide a unique and intuitive learning tool for students of the Japanese language, making the process of understanding kanji and vocabulary more engaging and memorable.
